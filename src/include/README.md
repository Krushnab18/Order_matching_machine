order.h – Order Management
This header deals with order creation and management logic.

Structs:
Order: Contains the order details such as orderId, type (buy/sell), stock symbol, price, quantity, and timestamp.
Functions:
createOrder: Initializes a new order object.
printOrder: Prints the details of a given order.
freeOrder: Frees dynamically allocated memory (if used).
2. orderbook.h – Order Book Management
This header focuses on storing, adding, and removing orders from the order book.

Structs:
OrderNode: A linked list node containing an order and a pointer to the next node.
Functions:
initializeOrderBook: Sets up the order book (e.g., empty list or arrays).
addOrder: Adds a buy or sell order to the order book.
removeOrder: Removes an order using its ID.
displayOrderBook: Prints all orders in the order book.
findMatchingOrder: Finds a matching counterpart for a given order (e.g., buy vs sell).
3. matching.h – Matching Engine
This header is core to the matching logic. It ensures orders are matched based on type, price, and quantity.

Functions:
matchOrders: Initiates the order matching process by comparing buy and sell orders.
executeTrade: Executes a trade when two matching orders are found.
handlePartialMatch: Manages cases where only part of the order can be fulfilled.
4. io.h – Input/Output Management
This header handles file reading and logging to interact with external files.

Functions:
readOrdersFromFile: Reads orders from an input file (e.g., CSV).
writeMatchedTradesToFile: Records successful trades to an output file.
logError: Logs errors during runtime to help with debugging.
5. utils.h – Utility Functions
This header contains helper functions that can be reused throughout the program.

Functions:
compareTime: Compares timestamps (e.g., to process FIFO matching).
handleError: Manages errors like invalid input or order mismatches.
trimWhitespace: Cleans input strings by removing unnecessary spaces.
Summary of the Headers
order.h: Deals with creating and managing individual orders.
orderbook.h: Manages the collection of orders in the order book.
matching.h: Contains the logic for matching buy and sell orders.
io.h: Handles reading/writing orders and trades to/from files.
utils.h: Provides helper functions for general operations like string handling and time comparison.
This modular structure ensures your project is easy to maintain, scalable, and well-organized, enabling you to focus on individual components separately.
